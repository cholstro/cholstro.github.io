      <p>I believe that teaching is the most important aspect of academic life. When we share our knowledge, we learn 
	  our subjects more deeply and learn from our students. I also believe that academics, as recipients of extensive
	  training, have a duty to teach others.</p>
      <p>My teaching philosophy focuses on supporting students with scaffolding and feedback and on helping students improve 
	      through hands-on practice and iteration. I apply the following principles in my teaching:
           <ul>
             <li>Focus on the students and what they need. Be available, responsive, and understanding.</li>
	     <li>Engage students as complete people, not just job-skill seekers.</li>
	     <li>Make class sessions interactive and encourage students to shape the class with their questions and discussion.</li>
	     <li>Provide detailed feedback that helps students learn and improve.</li>
	     <li>Create a safe and empowering learning environment for students of all backgrounds.</li>
	     <li>Clearly communicate to students the learning objectives of each class session and activity.</li>
	     <li>Design learning activities and assignments that provide meaningful hands-on experience.</li>
	     <li>Be my authentic self, including admitting what I don't know.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
     <p>I have over 20 years of teaching experience in various roles and settings. I started as a lab instructor, grader, physics tutor, and
     writing center advisor while earning my Bachelor's degree at Gustavus Adolphus College. As a Master's student at the University of Washington,
     I taught my own section of an introductory technical writing course to approximately 25 engineering undergraduates per quarter.</p>
     <p>When I started working in industry, I continued to teach. At IBM, I led trainings on new tools and technologies and mentored interns. I
     taught Google engineers a popular course about technical writing for eleven years, developed a mentoring program for early career technical
     writers, and taught a class about how to find information within Google to new engineers. My management style focused very much on teaching
     and coaching.</p>
     <p>While working at Google, I developed and taught a software documentation class in the University of Washington's Certificate in 
     Professional Technical Writing program. This class was my first chance to design and manage all aspects of a class, and it helped me
     solidify my love of teaching.</p>
     <p>While working on my PhD at UW, I have been the instructor of record for three writing courses (<em>ENGL 199: Interdisciplinary
	Writing/Natural Science</em>, <em>ENGL 299: Technical and Professional Writing</em>, and <em>ENGL 288: Introduction to Professional and 
	     Technical Writing</em>) and a data science programming 
	course (<em>INFO 201: Technical Foundations of Informatics</em>). I also served as the TA for a variety of information 
	science courses: <em>Informatics Capstone</em>, <em>History and Foundations of Libraries and Librarianship</em>,
	<em>Organization of Information and Resources</em>, and <em>Introduction to Information Architecture</em>.</p>

     <h2>Course Websites</h2>
    	    <h3><a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1397683">ENGL 288 - Introduction to Professional and Technical Writing</a></h3>
      <p>This course represented an update to ENGL 299, as the course received a permanent course number and I fully transitioned my teaching
	approach to online delivery. I recorded short videos for all of my lectures and expanded in-class activities to reinforce concepts from
	the readings and lectures and to give students opportunities to practice writing and critiquing others' writing. I continued to meet in-person
	with each student for each assignment sequence to review their drafts and to discuss their growth as writers.</p>
	    <h3><a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1376834/">ENGL 299 - Technical and Professional Writing</a></h3>
      <p>I developed this course as a new offering in the English Department's Interdisciplinary Writing Program
      and taught it to 20 students. Assignments included writing resumes, cover letters, instructions and procedures,
      technical reports, and professional correspondence. All assignments were scaffolded with small writing tasks,
      peer and instructor feedback, and iterative drafts. The course presented a particular pedagogical challenge
      because, in addition to being a completely new course, I unexpectedly had develop it as an online course
	      because of covid-19.</p>
     <h3><a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1320018/">ENGL 199 - Interdisciplinary Writing/Natural Science</a></h3>
      <p>I taught this writing course to 20 undergraduate students who were concurrently enrolled in an introductory planetary sciences
      course, ASTRO 150. I designed the course materials almost from scratch, focusing on an iterative writing process, thematic integration
      with ASTRO 150, and careful reading and annotation to understand rhetorical approaches. I provided students
      with lots of personalized feedback and scaffolded assignments to help students take small and manageable steps to improve
      their writing.
     <h3><a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1303939">INFO 201 - Technical Foundations of Informatics</a></h3>
      <p>I taught this introductory data science course to 35 UW undergraduate students during the summer of 2019.
       Course content included R programming, data analysis, data visualization, markdown, and Github.
       I used existing materials developed by the textbook author, including assignments, quizzes, most of the exercises,
       and some of the slides, but had to customize the course significantly to fit it into a condensed summer schedule.
     <h3><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/uwtc426/">TC 426 - Introduction to Software User Assistance</a></h3>
      <p>I developed this course from scratch in 2008 and taught it for two years to about 25 students pursuing a
       Certificate in Professional Technical Writing at UW. I structured the class around building a complete
       doc set for the students' portfolios. The class met once a week in the evening and was aimed at mid-career
       professionals.</p>
     <h2>Additional Teaching Materials</h2>
     <h3><a href="teaching-materials/IMT530-Presentation5a.pdf">Building Ontologies: Semantic Relationships and Competency Questions</a></h3>
	    <p>This lecture was part of <em>IMT 530: Organization of Information and Resources</em>, which was all about building taxonomies and ontologies. I structured
       these materials, which were central to course, around the assigned readings and included many examples from my personal and professional life.
       The students particularly appreciated the discussion of my ontology-focused projects at Google because they were career-focused
       Masters students and the demonstration of Protege because class exercises and assignments were all completed in PoolParty.
     <h3><a href="teaching-materials/IMT530-Presentation4a.pdf">Subject Indexing: Information Objects and Concepts in Taxonomies and Ontologies</a></h3>
	    <p>This lecture was part of <em>IMT 530: Organization of Information and Resources</em>, which was all about building taxonomies and ontologies. I developed
       these materials based on my own experience and the assigned readings for the day. I built the discussion around a particularly interesting
       information object, <em>The Raven and the First Men</em> by Bill Reid, and some related information objects. I delivered this to a small and
       enaged class of graduate students, so it involved a significant amount of discussion.
     <h3><a href="teaching-materials/03_Subject_Analysis.pdf">Subject Analysis</a></h3>
	    <p>This lecture was part of <em>LIS 530: Organization of Information and Resources</em>. I developed 
     the materials based on an existing slide deck, but made significant changes to
     the content and the presentation style. I changed the framing with the opening slides, 
     fleshed out the sections on Wilson's methods, added examples of subject analysis and
     the section on Langridge, and streamlined the facets section. Many students cited 
     this lecture as their favorite lecture in the class. I was invited to give an updated
     version of this lecture the following year and added a discussion of a Birger Hjørland
     reading to give students a stronger philosophical grounding. Finally, I built a 
     <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1387774">prototype flipped classroom design</a>
      of the lecture materials in Canvas.</p>
     <h3><a href="teaching-materials/IMT535-Week-06-Org-Systems.pdf">Information Architecture: Organization Systems</a></h3>
      <p >This short lecture was the second half of a two-part lecture in <em>IMT 535: Information Architecture</em>. The lecture
	      connects classification with information architecture and uses concrete examples from my work as the information
	      architect for cloud.google.com documentation.</p>
     <h3><a href="teaching-materials/Digital-Libraries.pdf">Digitization of Libraries</a></h3>
      <p>This lecture was part of <em>LIS 501: History And Foundations of Libraries And Librarianship</em>. I developed the materials
	  myself, but fit it into the larger narrative of the course. I structured the content around 1) digital technologies  
	  for classification and retrieval and 2) digital content itself. I had the students write a response essay where
          they considered which move to digital technologies had a bigger impact on libraries. I also paired the lecture 
	      with an exercise where students evaluated and presented to the class about different digital libraries.</p>
     <h3><a href="teaching-materials/Vignette-Cutter.pdf">Charles Cutter Vignette</a></h3>
      <p>This short lecture was part of a series of vignettes in
	      <em>LIS 501: History And Foundations of Libraries And Librarianship</em> that introduced students to key historical figures, places, and moments.
       I focused on Cutter numbers because most of the students were in their first year of an MLIS program and were hungry to learn
       technical details of the profession.</p>
     <!--<p><a href="teaching-materials/Info-Seeking-Behavior.pdf">Information Seeking Behavior</a></p>
      <p style="margin-left:10px">I gave a lecture and led the discussion for one session
     of the seminar course, INSC 518: Human Information Behavior. The students had little or no background in the topic and the course covered a wide
     range of topics, so I tried to provide a basic overview and a few frameworks to scaffold discussion. I used student responses to the readings
     and a series of questions to spark discussion. If I teach this topic again, I'll probably include an additional framework like berrypicking and move
     precision and recall to a separate session about information retrieval.</p>-->
    <!-- <p><a href="teaching-materials/John-Dewey.pdf">John Dewey, American Pragmatist</a></p>
      <p style="margin-left:10px">I gave this short presentation as part of a series of seminar
    talks about scholars and philosophers. I aimed to include as much as I could about John Dewey's accomplishments because he is one of the great
    American thinkers and doers, but focused primarily on his approach to pragmatism.</p></div>-->
