      <p>My research in knowledge organization focuses on <strong>subject indexing</strong>, the multi-step process of
      determining what a resource is about (subject analysis) and then representing that aboutness in an 
      indexing language (subject representation). 
      
      <p>I am particularly interested in comparing how different types of subject indexers do this work and in identifying
	ways to combine the approaches and techniques of these different types of indexers. While every individual subject 
	indexer has different experience, training, and motivations, I use a framework with four types of subject indexers
	in my research:
	      
	<ul>
        <li><strong>Professional indexers</strong>, such as librarians and archivists
        <li><strong>Domain and folk experts</strong>, such as folk biologists and other academics and professionals</li>
        <li><strong>Casual indexers</strong>, such as social taggers and ad hoc organizers of small and often personal information spaces</li>
        <li><strong>Machine indexers</strong>, such as neural nets that classify and cluster information based on algorithms and training data</li>
      </ul>
	    
      <p>Drafty... social and ethical implications  
      <p> how relatively recent technological developments like large digital
      collections and data sets, social tagging, and machine classification and clustering influence subject
      indexing. 
      
      <p>I typically study subject indexing through case studies of specific subject indexers working with
      specific collections, focusing on the artifacts that they create&mdash;both the indexes themselves and
      artifacts that reveal their processes.
      
      <p>I consider myself a Pragmatist when it comes to subject indexing, focusing on workable
      solutions that help people find information. 
      
     
      
     
       <h2>Research Questions</h2>
       <p>My research aims to answer three types of questions about subject indexers. 
       
       <h3>>Comparison of Types of Subject Indexers</h3>
         <p>How do different types of subject indexers compare in their motivations, biases
         tools, processes, and evaluation tech? Researchers like Adler, Bates and Rowley, 
         Kipp, and others have done good research in this space, but I think that we can learn 
         more, especially about domain experts and machines, through direct comparison of the
         indexes that different subject indexers produce and notes about their processes and 
         decision-making. We can also learn about these other subject indexers through studies
         that observe and describe their processes, tools, and outputs but do not explicitly
		 compare them other types of subject indexers.</p>
        
	 <h3>Hybrid Subject Indexing Approaches in Digital Environments</h3>
        <p>Do subject indexers adopt tools and processes that were initially developed by
         other types of subject indexers? For example, many libraries have incorporated social
         tags into their catalogs (Maness, Furner). How did librarians learn about and evaluate
         that technology? What were the barriers to adoption? When is adopting tools and
         processes from other subject indexers most fruitful? Can we use this knowledge to
         build hybrid subject indexing approaches? I believe that these questions
         of adoption are especially interesting with the emergence of digital technology
         and very large digital collections. In particular, I want to emphasize the impact
         of social tagging (Golder and Huberman, Munk and Mork, and others), machine indexers
         (De Campos, et al., Golub, Mikolov et al., and others), and digital cataloging
         and indexing tools (Soergel) on subject indexing in this emergent digital environment.</p>
	    
         <h3>Subject Indexing at Social, Cultural, and Ethical Intersections</h3>
        <p>How do the motivations, processes, and tools of different
         types of subject indexers intersect with social, cultural, and ethical aspects of
         subject indexing? Can folksonomies represent minority voices? Can machine indexers
         overcome biases in their training data? How do subject indexers promote social justice?
         How do the answers to that question change depending on the type of subject indexer?
         How can indexes reflect and honor both mainstream and folk wisdom? Because indexes codify the
         views of subject indexers in persistent and powerful ways, understanding how different 
         subject indexers arrive at their views and representation choices is critical.
      
      
     <h2>Social Tagging and Folksonomies</h2>
     <p>So far, I have researched social and casual indexers more than other types of indexers. 
     I loved the old tagging service de.licio.us and am fascinated by any social tagging website, 
     including <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/tags/">MetaFilter</a>,
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/">Flickr</a>, 
      and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf">Goodreads</a>.
      <p>In these folksonomies, the crowd collectively determines what something is and where it goes. Folksonomies 
      usually lack hierarchy, and new metadata is added on an ongoing basis, which makes for adaptable and flexible
      classification schemes. Of course, the crowd isn't always "right" and isn't always organized, but that's 
      part of what makes social tagging and folksonomies so interesting.
     <p>I don't just observe social tagging in wild; I also build tagging tools. I built tag-based navigation and retrieval
       tools for Google's internal documentation that allowed Google engineers to define terms and tag key resources.
       As a researcher, I have studied people's tagging behaviors in controlled experiments. You can use the
     <a href="http://students.washington.edu/cholstro/tag">experimental taggging user interface</a> that I built for some of my research.
